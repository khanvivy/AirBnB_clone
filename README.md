# AirBnB Clone - The Console
The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project at Holberton School that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.

#### Functionalities of this command interpreter:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Environment
This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)

## Installation
* Clone this repository: `git clone "https://github.com/khanvivy/AirBnB_clone.git"`
* Access AirBnb directory: `cd AirBnB_clone`
* Run hbnb(interactively): `./console` and enter command
* Run hbnb(non-interactively): `echo "<command>" | ./console.py`

## File Descriptions
[console.py](console.py) - the console contains the entry point of the command interpreter. 
List of commands this console current supports:
* `EOF` - exits console 
* `quit` - exits console
* `<emptyline>` - overwrites default emptyline method and does nothing
* `create` - Creates a new instance of`BaseModel`, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id
* `destroy` - Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). 
* `show` - Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.
* `all` - Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. 
* `update` - Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). 

#### `models/` directory contains classes used for this project:
[base_model.py](/models/base_model.py) - The BaseModel class from which future classes will be derived
* `def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` - Initialization of the base model
* `def __str__(self)` - String representation of the BaseModel class
* `def save(self)` - Updates the attribute `updated_at` with the current datetime
* `def to_dict(self)` - returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of the instance

Classes inherited from Base Model:
* [amenity.py](/models/amenity.py)
* [city.py](/models/city.py)
* [place.py](/models/place.py)
* [review.py](/models/review.py)
* [state.py](/models/state.py)
* [user.py](/models/user.py)

#### `/models/engine` directory contains File Storage class that handles JASON serialization and deserialization :
[file_storage.py](/models/engine/file_storage.py) - serializes instances to a JSON file & deserializes back to instances
* `def all(self)` - returns the dictionary __objects
* `def new(self, obj)` - sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id
* `def save(self)` - serializes __objects to the JSON file (path: __file_path)
* ` def reload(self)` -  deserializes the JSON file to __objects

---
## Install Flask
```
$ pip3 install Flask
```



* Update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v3
* Update the README.md:
* Add yourself as an author of the project
* Add new information about your new contribution
* Make it better!
* If you’re the owner of this codebase, create a new repository called AirBnB_clone_v3 and copy over all files from AirBnB_clone_v2

### [1. Never fail!](./tests)
Since the beginning we’ve been using the unittest module, but do you know why unittests are so important? Because when you add a new feature, you refactor a piece of code, etc… you want to be sure you didn’t break anything.

At Holberton School, we have (as of 08/04/2022), 5213 unittests just for the intranet and they all pass!

The following requirements must be met for your project:
* all current tests must pass (don’t delete them…)
* add new tests as much as you can (tests are mandatory for some tasks)
```

### [2. Code review]

Like “tests”, code review is the base of all software development.

All companies are using this “feature” to improve the codebase, but also the group dynamic. For example, at [Zenly](https://zen.ly/), the iOS team does a code review everyday at 5pm with the entire team.

What is a code review?

Code review helps developers learn the code base, as well as help them learn new technologies and techniques that grow their skill sets.

When a developer is finished working on an issue, another developer looks over the code and considers questions like:

* Are there any obvious logic errors in the code?
* Looking at the requirements, are all cases fully implemented?
* Are the new automated tests sufficient for the new code? Do existing automated tests need to be rewritten to account for changes in the code?
* Does the new code conform to existing style guidelines?

* [Github - code review tool](https://github.com/features#code-review)

* [Merging vs. Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

For this project, you will need to review a peer’s pull request on the branch storage_get_count (which will be made for question 3), and then accept the pull request, with your review in the comments.

What we expect:
* a file code_review.txt, containing the Github username of the student you reviewed (ex: If you did the review of JohnDoe, code_review.txt must contain JohnDoe)
* The code review must be done on Github, in the comments for the pull request:
* the pull request must be created from the branch storage_get_count by a peer
* only the reviewer can approve the pull request
* don’t delete the branch storage_get_count after approval
* The comments must contain at least one useful comment:
* questions about the piece of code, if it’s difficult to understand
* style issues
* error handling
* duplicate code
* potential bugs
* potential efficiency issues
* typographical errors

We are all human, we all make mistakes, typos, etc… another developer will always find something in your code.

### [3. Improve storage](./models)
Update DBStorage and FileStorage, adding two new methods. All changes should be done in the branch storage_get_count:

A method to retrieve one object:
* Prototype: def get(self, cls, id):
* cls: class name
* id: string representing the object ID
* Returns the object based on the class name and its ID, or None if not found

A method to count the number of objects in storage:
* Prototype: def count(self, cls=None):
* cls: class name (optional)
* Returns the number of objects in storage matching the given class name. If no name is passed, returns the count of all objects in storage.

Don’t forget to add new tests for these 2 methods on each storage engine.
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ cat test_get_count.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" Test .get() and .count() methods
"""
from models import storage
from models.state import State

print("All objects: {}".format(storage.count()))
print("State objects: {}".format(storage.count(State)))

first_state_id = list(storage.all(State).values())[0].id
print("First state: {}".format(storage.get(State, first_state_id)))
 
```
For this task, you must make a pull request on Github.com, and ask at least one of your peer to review and merge it.

Please do not delete this branch, a manual review for grading will be done using this branch.

### [4. Status of your API](./api)

It’s time to start your API!

```
